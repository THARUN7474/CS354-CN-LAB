Let’s break this down step by step. We'll cover the essential concepts and step-by-step guidance for each inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism (FIFO/Named Pipes, Message Queues, and Shared Memory). I'll also explain the underlying theory and how to implement it in C.

### **What is IPC (Inter-Process Communication)?**
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) allows processes (programs) to exchange data and signals. It is critical for client-server systems, where the client sends requests to the server, and the server processes and responds to those requests.

**Common IPC Mechanisms**:
1. **FIFO/Named Pipes**: Used for sequential communication between processes. It allows data transfer in a one-way or two-way stream.
2. **Message Queues**: Allows processes to send and receive messages stored in a queue structure.
3. **Shared Memory**: The fastest form of IPC, where a shared segment of memory is accessible by multiple processes.

### **Step 1: FIFO (Named Pipes)**

#### **Concept of FIFO (Named Pipes)**
- A FIFO is a special file type created to allow communication between two unrelated processes.
- It operates as a named pipe, meaning data written by one process can be read by another, even if they are running independently.

#### **Steps for Implementing FIFO**
1. **Create the FIFO file**: Use `mkfifo()` system call to create a named pipe.
2. **Open the FIFO**:
   - The **client** opens the FIFO for writing.
   - The **server** opens the FIFO for reading.
3. **Exchange data**:
   - The client writes messages into the pipe.
   - The server reads messages from the pipe.
4. **Close and cleanup**: Close the file descriptors and remove the FIFO file using `unlink()`.

#### **Code Example for FIFO**

**Server Code (`server_fifo.c`)**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

#define FIFO_NAME "myfifo"
#define BUFFER_SIZE 256

int main() {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Create the FIFO if it doesn't exist
    if (mkfifo(FIFO_NAME, 0666) == -1) {
        perror("mkfifo");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    printf("Server: Waiting for clients...\n");
    
    // Open the FIFO for reading
    int fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    while (1) {
        // Read messages from the FIFO
        ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
        if (bytes_read > 0) {
            buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string
            printf("Server received: %s\n", buffer);
            
            if (strcmp(buffer, "exit") == 0) {
                printf("Server shutting down...\n");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    close(fd);
    unlink(FIFO_NAME); // Remove the FIFO
    return 0;
}
```

**Client Code (`client_fifo.c`)**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define FIFO_NAME "myfifo"
#define BUFFER_SIZE 256

int main() {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Open the FIFO for writing
    int fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_WRONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    printf("Client: Type your messages (type 'exit' to quit):\n");
    while (1) {
        // Get user input
        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
        buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = '\0'; // Remove trailing newline
        
        // Write the message to the FIFO
        if (write(fd, buffer, strlen(buffer)) == -1) {
            perror("write");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        
        if (strcmp(buffer, "exit") == 0) {
            printf("Client exiting...\n");
            break;
        }
    }
    
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### **Compiling and Running the FIFO Example**
1. Compile the programs:
   ```bash
   gcc server_fifo.c -o server_fifo
   gcc client_fifo.c -o client_fifo
   ```
2. Run the server first:
   ```bash
   ./server_fifo
   ```
3. In another terminal, run the client:
   ```bash
   ./client_fifo
   ```

4. Exchange messages! Type in the client terminal, and you’ll see the output on the server terminal.

### **Next Steps**
Let me know once you've tried this! We can then move to **Message Queues**, which introduce the concept of storing messages in a structured way with additional features like priorities.
